Jay Fenlason's Original Hack (1982) - Research Fork
This is a research fork of the original repository containing Jay Fenlason's 1982 Hack source code.
Provenance
This source was preserved by Brian Harvey, Computer Science teacher at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School (1979-1982), and provided to Dan Stormont in 2024 for the Snap!Hack educational project.
Chain of custody:

Jay Fenlason (original author, 1982)
Brian Harvey (preserved from LSRHS PDP-11 backups, 1982-2024)
Dan Stormont (Snap!Hack project, 2024-present)

Historical Significance
This is Jay Fenlason's complete development directory from Lincoln-Sudbury, including:

Three development iterations (root → exp → exp1)
Personal Unix environment (.cshrc, .login, .exrc)
Experimental /zork directory
Build artifacts and development notes
The universal levels 1-4 that all Hack variants inherited

This source predates all known distributed versions including:

Andries Brouwer's Hack 1.0 (1985)
The stolen PDP-11 Hack (Feb 1985)
Hack 1.0.3 (final Andries version)
